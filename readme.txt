IP-AddressChangeNotifier-Python

Similar to the other IP Address change notifier but written
in Python and cross platform (Linux, Windows)

Creates a file with information on current IP address and how
long its been since the last IP address change.

Useful for those on a dynamic IP address.

In Linux, use crontab to have it run periodically.
In Windows, use scheduler or place in startup folder to run
on startup.
